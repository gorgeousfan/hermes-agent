"""Regression: env-immune spawn-owner capture for the WebUI Option 3
cross-session wakeup misroute safety net.

Background (RCA: rca-xsession-wakeup-misroute.md): a
``terminal(background=true, notify_on_complete=true)`` spawn historically
captured its owner session from the process-global
``os.environ['HERMES_SESSION_KEY']`` via ``get_current_session_key``. Two
concurrent WebUI turns race on that single global slot, so session A's
watcher could wake session B.

This module proves the core-side primitive that makes WebUI Option 3
(``api/background_process._resolve_wakeup_target``) actually able to
detect that misroute:

* ``tools.approval.get_env_immune_session_key()`` reads context-local
  state ONLY — never ``os.environ`` — so a concurrent turn overwriting
  the global slot cannot corrupt it.
* ``ProcessSession.spawn_session_id`` is stamped from that env-immune
  value at spawn and is one of the duck-typed attribute names Option 3
  probes.
* When no per-turn identity contextvar is bound (CLI / cron / plain
  tests / pre-Option-1 WebUI), the value is ``""`` so Option 3 stays a
  pure pass-through and never suppresses a valid wakeup.

These are behavioral invariants exercised against the REAL modules, not
source-text change-detectors.

# Canon

The Canon platform plugin connects Hermes directly to Canon conversations over
Canon's REST and SSE APIs. It is the long-term native channel for
Canon-Hermes deployments and does not require the legacy Node sidecar bridge.

## Authentication

Use one credential mode:

```bash
CANON_API_KEY=agk_live_...
```

or profile mode:

```bash
CANON_AGENT=leonardo-2
CANON_AGENTS_JSON_BOOTSTRAP='{"leonardo-2":{"apiKey":"...","agentId":"...","agentName":"Leonardo 2","clientType":"hermes"}}'
```

Profile mode reads `~/.canon/agents.json`. On Railway, set `HOME=/data` so the
profile file lives at `/data/.canon/agents.json` on the persistent volume.
`CANON_AGENTS_JSON_BOOTSTRAP` can seed a fresh volume and is merged without
overwriting existing profiles.

`CANON_API_KEY` has highest priority when both modes are present.

## Optional Settings

- `CANON_BASE_URL` overrides the Canon REST API base URL.
- `CANON_STREAM_URL` overrides the Canon SSE stream URL.
- `CANON_HOME_CHANNEL` sets the default conversation for cron/send-message
  delivery.
- `CANON_ALLOWED_USERS` restricts inbound users. Use this for owner/contact
  deployments, for example `CANON_ALLOWED_USERS=canon_user_id_1,canon_user_id_2`.
- `CANON_ALLOW_ALL_USERS=1` allows any Canon user to talk to the agent.

When `CANON_ALLOWED_USERS` is set, unlisted direct-message senders are ignored
instead of receiving pairing codes, unless you explicitly configure Canon's
platform `unauthorized_dm_behavior` back to `pair`.

## Deployment Note

Normal Canon Hermes should enable only the `canon-platform` plugin. Priority
deployments should compose the same runtime with the external Priority Hermes
pack; Priority skills do not belong in this runtime's global `skills/` tree.

# Programmatic Integration

Hermes ships three protocols for driving the agent from external programs — IDE plugins, custom UIs, CI pipelines, embedded sub-agents. Pick the one that matches your transport and consumer.

| Protocol | Transport | Best for | Defined by |
|----------|-----------|----------|------------|
| **ACP** | JSON-RPC over stdio | IDE clients (VS Code, Zed, JetBrains) that already speak the [Agent Client Protocol](https://github.com/zed-industries/agent-client-protocol) | `acp_adapter/` |
| **TUI gateway** | JSON-RPC over stdio (or WebSocket) | Custom hosts that want fine-grained control of sessions, slash commands, approvals, and streaming events | `tui_gateway/server.py` |
| **API server** | HTTP + Server-Sent Events | OpenAI-compatible frontends (Open WebUI, LobeChat, LibreChat…) and language-agnostic web clients | `gateway/platforms/api_server.py` |

All three drive the same `AIAgent` core. They differ only in wire format and which set of features they expose.

---

## ACP (Agent Client Protocol)

`hermes acp` starts a stdio JSON-RPC server speaking ACP. Used in production by VS Code (Zed Industries' ACP extension), Zed, and any JetBrains IDE with an ACP plugin.

Capabilities exposed: session creation, prompt submission, streaming agent message chunks, tool-call events, permission requests, session fork, cancel, and authentication. Tool output is rendered into ACP `Diff`/`ToolCall` content blocks the IDE understands.

Full lifecycle, event bridge, and approval flow: [ACP Internals](./acp-internals).

```bash
hermes acp                  # serve ACP on stdio
hermes acp --bootstrap      # print install snippet for an ACP-capable IDE
```

---

## TUI Gateway JSON-RPC

`tui_gateway/server.py` is the protocol the Ink TUI (`hermes --tui`) and the embedded dashboard PTY bridge talk to. Any external host can speak the same protocol over stdio (or WebSocket via `tui_gateway/ws.py`).

### Method catalog (selected)

```
prompt.submit           prompt.background       session.steer
session.create          session.list            session.interrupt
session.history         session.compress        session.branch
session.title           session.usage           session.status
sessions.patch          session.patch           (alias of sessions.patch)
clarify.respond         sudo.respond            secret.respond
approval.respond        config.set / config.get commands.catalog
command.resolve         command.dispatch        cli.exec
reload.mcp              reload.env              process.stop
delegation.status       subagent.interrupt      spawn_tree.save / list / load
terminal.resize         clipboard.paste         image.attach
```

### `sessions.patch` — partial session update

`sessions.patch` (and its `session.patch` alias) lets a client update one or
more session fields in a single round-trip — used by Hermes Desktop's
"Edit session" panel (issue
[#27455](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues/27455)).

```jsonc
// Request
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "sessions.patch",
  "params": {
    "session_id": "<ephemeral sid from session.create>",
    "patch": {
      "title": "Refactor the kanban worker",
      "system_prompt": "You are a meticulous reviewer..."
    }
  }
}

// Response
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "session_id": "<sid>",
    "session_key": "<db row id>",
    "patched": {
      "title": "Refactor the kanban worker",
      "system_prompt": "You are a meticulous reviewer..."
    },
    "skipped": []
  }
}
```

The flat shape `{ "session_id": "...", "title": "..." }` is also accepted in
addition to the nested `patch` object so the runtime adapter on the client
side can use whichever shape is more convenient.

**Supported fields:** `title`, `system_prompt`. Unknown fields are listed in
`skipped` rather than failing the call — newer clients can add fields
without breaking older gateways.

**Error codes:**

| Code   | Meaning                                                  |
|--------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `4001` | session not found (ephemeral `session_id` unknown)       |
| `4021` | `title` must be a non-empty string                       |
| `4022` | `title` is already in use by another session             |
| `4025` | no patchable fields supplied (or only unknown fields)    |
| `4027` | `system_prompt` is not a string (pass `""` to clear)     |
| `5007` | session DB unavailable / write failed                    |

When `system_prompt` is patched the in-memory agent's cached prompt is
invalidated so the next conversation-loop turn picks up the new value
without restarting the session.

### Events streamed back

`message.delta`, `message.complete`, `tool.start`, `tool.progress`, `tool.complete`, `approval.request`, `clarify.request`, `sudo.request`, `secret.request`, `gateway.ready`, plus session lifecycle and error events.

### Pi-style RPC mapping

Every command in the Pi-mono RPC spec ([issue #360](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues/360)) has a TUI-gateway equivalent:

| Pi command | Hermes equivalent |
|------------|-------------------|
| `prompt` | `prompt.submit` (or ACP `session/prompt`) |
| `steer` | `session.steer` |
| `follow_up` | `prompt.submit` queued after current turn |
| `abort` | `session.interrupt` |
| `set_model` | `command.dispatch` for `/model <provider:model>` (mid-session, persistent) |
| `compact` | `session.compress` |
| `get_state` | `session.status` |
| `get_messages` | `session.history` |
| `switch_session` | `session.resume` |
| `fork` | `session.branch` |
| `ui_request` / `ui_response` | `clarify.respond` / `sudo.respond` / `secret.respond` / `approval.respond` |

## OpenAI-Compatible API Server

`gateway/platforms/api_server.py` exposes hermes over HTTP for any client that already speaks the OpenAI format. Useful when you want a web frontend, a curl-driven CI runner, or a non-Python consumer.

Endpoints:

```
POST /v1/chat/completions        OpenAI Chat Completions (streaming via SSE)
POST /v1/responses               OpenAI Responses API (stateful)
POST /v1/runs                    Start a run, returns run_id (202)
GET  /v1/runs/{id}               Run status
GET  /v1/runs/{id}/events        SSE stream of lifecycle events
POST /v1/runs/{id}/approval      Resolve a pending approval
POST /v1/runs/{id}/stop          Interrupt the run
GET  /v1/capabilities            Machine-readable feature flags
GET  /v1/models                  Lists hermes-agent
GET  /health, /health/detailed
```

Setup, headers (`X-Hermes-Session-Id`, `X-Hermes-Session-Key`), and frontend wiring: [API Server](../user-guide/features/api-server).

## Which one should I use?

- **You're writing an IDE plugin and the IDE already speaks ACP** → ACP. Zero protocol work on the IDE side.
- **You're writing a custom desktop / web / TUI host and want every Hermes feature** (slash commands, approvals, clarify, multi-agent, session branching) → TUI gateway JSON-RPC.
- **You want any OpenAI-compatible frontend, a language-agnostic HTTP client, or curl-driven automation** → API server.
- **You want a Python in-process embed without a subprocess** → import `run_agent.AIAgent` directly. See [Agent Loop](./agent-loop).

---

## Model hot-swapping

Mid-session model switching works on every surface — it's the `/model` slash command under the hood.

- **CLI / TUI:** `/model claude-sonnet-4` or `/model openrouter:anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6`
- **TUI gateway RPC:** `command.dispatch` with `{"command": "/model claude-sonnet-4"}`
- **ACP:** the IDE sends the slash command as a prompt; the agent dispatches it
- **API server:** include a `model` field in the request body or set `X-Hermes-Model`

Provider-aware resolution (the same model name picks the right format for whatever provider you're on) is built in. See `hermes_cli/model_switch.py`.

---

## A note on `--mode rpc`

Hermes does not have a `--mode rpc` flag. The three protocols above already cover the use cases — ACP for IDE-protocol clients, the TUI gateway for stdio JSON-RPC hosts, and the API server for HTTP. If you find a real gap that none of them fill, open an issue with the concrete consumer you're building.
